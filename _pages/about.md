About me
======
I am currently working on research related to dialogue systems and am particularly interested in thinking about user experience with these systems in applications. 


My research has focused on working towards developing tools for mental health applications. In my postdoc this has taken the form of trying to develop a system that could help train counselors in active listening skills. In graduate a school I was more focused on applying ML to infer mood passively from smartphone sensor data to help individuals understand and monitor their wellbeing. 

Because I have led multiple user studies to collect human-generated datasets of various types, I have thought about the impact of systems in use. This experience has led me to be particularly interested in the evaluation of systems for reliable system performance. Working on applications, I have also collaborated on multi-disciplinary teams and enjoy working with complex and messy datasets.

**I am on the job market and excited to learn about new opportunities**
